title: "Market making in simple random world"
---

This script simulates profit of a market maker in a very simple world. In this world:
- there are no trading costs
- no short selling restrictions
- market maker's inventory is not allowed to be onle -1, 0, or 1

Each trading cycle looks like this:

1. midpoint price either decreases or increases by one from its previous value, randomly with equal probability (e.g. 100 -> 99, or 100 -> 101)
2. market maker instantly adjusts bid and ask, with bid-spead and ask-spread of 1 (e.g. midpoint = 100, bid = 99, ask = 101). If the invetory is already at -1, the market mar does no post the ask. f the invetory is 1, market maker is not allowe to post the bid.
3. A marketable trade (volume always equal to 1) arrives . If the trade is a buy and market maker's inventory is not -1, then he trades at his ask. If the inventory is -1 then the market maker does not trade. If the trade is a sell and market maker's inventory is not 1, market maker trades at the bid. If the inventory is 1, the market maker does not trade. 

We will simulate N trading cycles and look at the profit curve.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
N <- 10000
# avoid for loops, use vectorized code for speed
set.seed(123)  # so we are able to reproduce
midpoints <- cumsum(c(100, round(runif(N-1)) * 2 - 1))
marketable_trades <- round(runif(N)) * 2 - 1  # -1 means cash outflow, so market maker buys, or equivalently the bid is hit 

inventory_always_trade <- cumsum(marketable_trades)

market_maker_trades <- abs(inventory_always_trade) < 2

plot(cumsum(marketable_trades[market_maker_trades]), type='l')

head(market_maker_trades, 14)
head(marketable_trades, 10)
cumsum(head(marketable_trades, 10))
cumsum(head(marketable_trades, 14)[head(market_maker_trades, 14)])

head(marketable_trades, 14)
cumsum(head(marketable_trades, 14))





# compute the trade price (bid or ask) then compute the cash flow:
cash_flow <- (midpoints + trades) * trades
plot(cumsum(cash_flow), type='l')
plot(cumsum(trades), type='l')
head(cash_flow)
```
